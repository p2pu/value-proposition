 - First time online learners
 - Folks disenfranchised from higher ed

**Facilitators** - Librarian/Community Organizer/Volunteer - everything you need to assemble a learning community. No expertise required! Program in a box for people who want to support communities

**Institutions** - Library/Adult Ed Institution/Civil Society Org/Volunteer Org - Utilize what’s already out there to create vetted, high-quality programming that brings people into your doors. 

Institution sub-groups

- Adult Programming
- Basic computers, contemporary/local programming, hi-tech centers
- Small library without support for programming
- Systems with need for digital programs
- Large systems looking to better align/network programming

**Online course provider** - we have a model for learning and a community of learners and facilitators who have expertise, feedback, and demand.

**Municipality** - Develop alternative pathways for individuals to find success, and network the motivation and energy in your community into formative programs.

**Formal education institution + employers** - Support multiple entryways into your program: vet candidates through authentic experiences, rather than tests and interviews.

**Academic/Research** - Disseminate your work to widen audience by creating an online course that will be reached by a diverse audience of learners

**Society** - support inclusive, lifelong learning.

**Open source movement** - We build tools that serve as an open source meetup, infused with our theories of learning. We are also living “open” as an institution.

**Open Ed/OER movement** - P2PU brings all OER stakeholders under one roof -- learners, practitioners, course developers; and we have diverse opinions and feedback.

**Press/Media** - compelling stories of individuals and groups that buck the edtech trend

**Progressive movements** - We are building alternative futures without the hierarchy and oppression of neoliberal edtech and hierarchical formal education institutions.
